The proposed model current work  is named LADUI (LSTM based Anomaly Detection for Unsupervised learning using Inter-metric and trend correlation embedding) is an improvised version of VAE to detect anomalies. Multivariate time series data fed sequentially to a CNN(convolution neural network) and then to  LSTM (Long-short term  model) in VAE framework to learn the inter-metric correlation and trend correlation by training in end-to-end way.
